# Dataspace Protocol Contract Signing and Memorialization Overlay (SAMO)

This project defines an early version of a contract signing and memorialization overlay for the IDS Dataspace Protocol.

## Motivation

Dataspace participants may require non-repudiation of contract agreements. The overlay will define the messages and exchange patterns required to achieve this. Its goal is to
provide input for eventual standardization as part of the IDS Dataspace Protocol.

The overlay will support the following qualities of service:

### Non-repudiation

Non-repudiation is defined as:

> Protection against a participant falsely denying having sent a `ContractAgreementMessage` or a `ContractAgreementVerification` message.

### Reliability

It must be possible for implementations to support reliable message delivery for all overlay protocol exchanges.

### Confidentiality

The protocol must not expose counter-party identities to third-parties. For example, if a participant escrows non-repudiation data generated by an overlay algorithm with a third
party, that data must not contain information which can be used to identify the counter-party.
